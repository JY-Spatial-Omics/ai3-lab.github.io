## Our Research Focus

The Joe Yeong Laboratory is dedicated to advancing the field of spatial omics through innovative research and computational approaches.

### Current Research Areas

#### Spatial Transcriptomics
We develop and apply cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics technologies to understand gene expression patterns in their native tissue context.

#### Multi-omics Integration
Our laboratory specializes in integrating multiple omics datasets to provide comprehensive insights into biological systems.

#### Computational Biology
We develop novel computational methods and algorithms for analyzing complex spatial omics data.

#### Biomarker Discovery
Through our research, we identify and validate biomarkers for various diseases and biological processes.
